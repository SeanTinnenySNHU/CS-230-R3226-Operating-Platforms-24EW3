Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

  The game room client is a game room that would like a game that is hosted and playable by their patrons. 

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

  I believe that I explained the possible operating systems to host the game on very well.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

  I found that developing the UML diagramas helped the most while developing the code.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

  If I could revise one portion of my project it would be the recommendations portion of the design. The reason   I chose this is that I would like to have added more recommendations for scalability.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

  I interpreted users needs in my design by making the hosting not operating system dependatant to allow any   user to connect to the game. It is important to keep users needs in mind when designing so that the user     experience is what is expected from the software.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

  I initally looked into what was expected and started with implementing the features needed to get that       result. One strategy I would use is to build a UML of all objects in the system to allow me to connect all   of the moving parts together.
